## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

  - **Framework:** [Fastify](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.://www.fastify.io/) - A web framework focused on performance and low overhead.
  - **ORM:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
  - **Data Validation:** [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
  - **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
  - **Development Environment:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - To create a consistent, containerized database environment.
  - **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

#### **1. Initial Setup (Run these commands only once)**

This will clone the project, install all dependencies, and prepare the database.

```bash
# Clone the project and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/orafasantos/SweetProductsAPI.git
cd SweetProductsAPI

# Create the .env file for the database connection
# (On Windows, use 'copy' instead of 'cp')
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies for both the API (root) and the frontend
npm install
npm install --prefix frontend

# Start the PostgreSQL database container
docker-compose up -d

# Create the database tables with Prisma Migrate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

#### **2. Running the Application (Fast setup)**

You will need **two separate terminals** running at the same time.

**‚û°Ô∏è Terminal 1: Start the Back-End API**

In the project's root directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*Your API will be running at `http://localhost:3333`.*

**‚û°Ô∏è Terminal 2: Start the Front-End**

Navigate to the front-end's source folder and start the live server:

```bash
cd frontend/src
npx live-server
```

*This will automatically open your browser with the front-end application.*

And that's it\! Your full application is now up and running.
